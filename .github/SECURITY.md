## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should not be reported in public issues as they could be exploited by malicious actors.

### 2. **DO** report the vulnerability privately
Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us at [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com)

### 3. Include the following information in your report:
- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability**
- **The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)**
- **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)**
- **Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it**

### 4. What happens next?
- You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours
- We will investigate and provide updates on our progress
- Once the issue is confirmed, we will work on a fix
- We will coordinate the disclosure with you
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be clearly marked in the release notes.

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will work with security researchers to address vulnerabilities in a timely manner. We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to respond to issues before any disclosure
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service
- Not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason
